    "text": "6. Main Results\n\nImportant Predictors:\n\nRecursive feature elimination with a random forest algorithm to identify the most important predictors for yield at the national level. The predictors were ranked based on their relative importance in predicting yield using the mean decrease of root mean square error metric.\n\n\nThreshold Analysis:\n\nThe impact of four important predictors (total precipitation in July, maximum July temperature, minimum May temperature, and minimum September temperature) on yield. Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) were calculated for these predictors using both training and test datasets. The ALE plots illustrate how changes in predictor values affect yield (measured in lbs/acre).\n\n\nModel Performance:\n\nThe predictive performance of the best models at the national and state levels was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation (r) between predicted and actual values on the testing dataset. The trend of the relationship between predicted and actual values was visualized using a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing line with a 95% confidence interval. The analysis showed that the national model, based on the Random Forest regressor, performed better than state-level models in North Dakota and South Dakota, but state-level models outperformed the national model in the other states. The best state-level models for Colorado, Kansas, and Minnesota also used the Random Forest regressor, while the Gradient Boosting Machine regressor was used for Nebraska and Texas.\n\n\nFuture Yield Forecasts at the National Level:\n\nAverage yield forecasts at the national level were analyzed for three time periods and under different Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP). The average annual yield for 2022 was approximately 1940 lbs/acre, with error bars representing the standard deviation around this mean. Future yield forecasts were depicted as point estimates with error bars indicating variation (standard error), and lines illustrated yield changes across four time periods and under three SSPs. The SSPs included SSP 126 (“sustainable future”), SSP 245 (“middle of the road”), SSP 375 (“regional rivalry”), and SSP 585 (fossil-fueled development). Each SSP was characterized by specific factors such as global temperature rise, carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, inequality, and environmental concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Yield Forecasts at the State Level:\nAverage yield forecasts for each of the seven states were examined for three time periods and under different Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP). The latest average annual yield was represented by point estimates, with error bars indicating the standard deviation around the mean. Future yield forecasts were also depicted as point estimates with error bars reflecting the variation (standard error) around these predictions. The lines portrayed yield changes across the time periods and under four SSPs: SSP 126 (“sustainable future”), SSP 245 (“middle of the road”), SSP 375 (“regional rivalry”), and SSP 585 (fossil-fueled development). Each SSP was characterized by specific factors such as global temperature rise, carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, inequality, and environmental concerns."

    "text": "3. Data\n\nStudy Area and Data Sources:\n\nThe data for this study is centered around genotypes of Helianthus annuus derived from the HeliantHome database. Specifically, genotypes within the Level I ecoregions of the Great Plains and North American Deserts were used due to their significant population of H. annuus, in contrast to other ecoregions with scant populations rendering them statistically insignificant for analysis. The extraction process was facilitated by cross-referencing the geographic coordinates of each source population with a shapefile of Level I ecoregions obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency\n\nData Preparation:\n\nThis data illuminates a wide array of traits reflecting plant architecture, reproductive phenology, tissue chemistry, and morphology of multiple plant components, with trait values associated to one or more genotypes within each population. Utilizing R packages such as sf, jsonlite, and the tidyverse suite of packages, a combined dataset was generated encapsulating population coordinates, the categorical ecoregion assignment, the genotypes within these populations, and the corresponding functional trait data for each genotype. The dataset comprised 88 traits from 464 genotypes belonging to 49 populations.\nAn initial examination of the dataset was conducted to ascertain the percentage of missing values for each trait. One trait, the peduncle length of the first flower, which had 100% missing values, was eliminated from the dataset. The rest exhibited missing values at a rate of either 27% (seed traits), or &lt;5% (all other traits). Following this, the dataset, now housing 87 traits, was randomly segregated into a training dataset (70% of the data) and a testing dataset (30% of the data) to evaluate the predictive models on unseen data.\nImputation of missing data values was executed separately on the training and testing data using the proximity matrix from a Random Forest (RF) algorithm through the R package randomForest, ensuring no data leakage occurred. The data was then subjected to Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) on the training data to pinpoint the optimal subset of relevant traits. Post RFE, the Boruta algorithm was applied on the ‘Train optimal’ dataset to identify the most divergent traits, which were then used to train and evaluate two classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), on separate datasets dubbed ‘Train Boruta’ and ‘Test Boruta’. This methodology enabled the validation of the findings of RFE and Boruta, and facilitated an understanding of how well these identified traits predict ecoregion origin, thereby reflecting phenotypic divergence between populations from contrasting environments. Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots were employed to evaluate the specific impact on prediction probability of variation in trait values for each of the eight most important traits.\n\n\n\nWorkflow diagram outlining the steps undertaken in this project"

Feature selection and modeling methodology\n\nEmploying descriptive and predictive machine learning approaches like Recursive Feature Elimination, the Boruta algorithm, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine classifiers, the study delved into trait data analysis at the genus level and within each of the three major evolutionary clades within the genus.\nThe Mean Decrease of Gini Impurity within Random Forest was utilized to ascertain the relative importance of all traits to species divergence, ranking them accordingly. Finally, two classifiers, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine, were trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset to corroborate the validity of the findings from Recursive Feature Elimination and Boruta."

    "text": "Core Functionality\nChronoClimateHub is built using Streamlit which provides a dynamic and interactive platform for showcasing timelapse videos. Here’s a brief overview of the workflow based on the provided code snippets for different segments of the platform:\n\n1. Page Configuration:\n\nTitle and icon are set for the web page using st.set_page_config.\n\n\n\n2. Sidebar & Main Content Area:\n\nSidebar contains a success message guiding users to ‘Timelapse Videos’.\nA markdown formatted welcome message is displayed on the main content area with basic instructions for navigation.\n\n\n\n3. Video Display:\n\nThe page is divided into two columns using st.columns.\nTimelapse videos are displayed side by side in these columns, each accompanied by a caption.\n\n\n\n4. Data Source Information:\n\nA subheader is created using st.subheader to segregate the data source section.\nInformation about the data sources, including direct links to the datasets, are provided in markdown and text formats.\n\n\n\n5. Data Processing and Calculation:\n\nAnother subheader segregates the data processing section.\nDetails about data acquisition, cleaning, processing, and used libraries are provided.\n\nEach section of the workflow corresponds to a specific feature or functionality within the ChronoClimateHub platform. The sidebar, video display, data source information, and data processing details are presented in a structured and user-friendly manner, making the platform intuitive and informative."
