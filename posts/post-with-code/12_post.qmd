# Workflow üîÑ

## Core Functionality

ChronoClimateHub is built using Streamlit which provides a dynamic and interactive platform for showcasing timelapse videos. Here's a brief overview of the workflow based on the provided code snippets for different segments of the platform:

### **1. Page Configuration**:

-   Title and icon are set for the web page using `st.set_page_config`.

### **2. Sidebar & Main Content Area**:

-   Sidebar contains a success message guiding users to 'Timelapse Videos'.
-   A markdown formatted welcome message is displayed on the main content area with basic instructions for navigation.

### **3. Video Display**:

-   The page is divided into two columns using `st.columns`.
-   Timelapse videos are displayed side by side in these columns, each accompanied by a caption.

### **4. Data Source Information**:

-   A subheader is created using `st.subheader` to segregate the data source section.
-   Information about the data sources, including direct links to the datasets, are provided in markdown and text formats.

### **5. Data Processing and Calculation**:

-   Another subheader segregates the data processing section.
-   Details about data acquisition, cleaning, processing, and used libraries are provided.

Each section of the workflow corresponds to a specific feature or functionality within the ChronoClimateHub platform. The sidebar, video display, data source information, and data processing details are presented in a structured and user-friendly manner, making the platform intuitive and informative.

## Libraries and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

The workflow utilizes various Python libraries to handle data and display the content. Key libraries include: - **streamlit**: For creating the web app and displaying content. - **pandas**: For data manipulation. - **folium**: For map rendering. - **geopandas**: For handling geometric data. - **shapely**: For manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. - **ee**: For accessing Google Earth Engine data. - **rasterio**: For reading and writing geospatial raster data (e.g., GeoTIFF). - **os**: For interacting with the operating system.

Additionally, R libraries like **progress**, **transformr**, **gganimate**, **raster**, **ncdf4**, and the **tidyverse** suite of packages are used for data processing, visualization, and animation in the Temperature and SPEI segments of the project.

## Streamlit App Deployment üåê

The Streamlit app is hosted online, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the visual narratives of Earth's changes. The `st.set_page_config`, `st.write`, `st.markdown`, `st.video`, and `st.columns` functions, among others, are used extensively to structure the content, display the videos, and create an engaging user experience. The sidebar and main content area are organized to provide a straightforward navigation structure, enabling users to easily explore the timelapse chronicles and understand the underlying data and processing steps.

Through a combination of Streamlit's interactive features and Python's powerful data processing libraries, ChronoClimateHub offers a captivating platform to visualize and explore the profound transformations our planet is undergoing.
