# North American Sunflower Species Distribution

This project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of 22 wild sunflower species (Genus *Helianthus*) across different ecoregions in North America. In total there are 32 wild sunflower species which account for 50% of the genetic variation in the genus and hence form the diploid backbone. Here we visualize the centroid locations of 22 of them. The analysis is carried out using R, with a focus on spatial data handling and visualization.

## Libraries Used

-   `rgbif`: For accessing species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
-   `here`: For constructing file paths.
-   `tidyverse`: For data wrangling and visualization.
-   `sf`: For handling spatial data.
-   `RColorBrewer`: For color palettes.
-   `cowplot`, `gridExtra`, `grid`, `ggspatial`, `rayshader`: For advanced plotting and visualization.

## Data Sources

-   Species occurrence data from [GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)](https://www.gbif.org/)

    **Citation:** GBIF: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (2023) *What is GBIF?*. Available from <https://www.gbif.org/what-is-gbif> `[13 January 2020]`

-   [Ecoregion shapefile](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america) representing different level I ecoregions in North America.

## Workflow

### Data Collection:

-   Fetch a list of sunflower species and their occurrence data in North America from GBIF.

### Data Processing:

-   Filter and modify the retrieved data to isolate specific species and variables of interest.

### Spatial Data Handling:

-   Convert the data frame to a spatial object and perform coordinate transformations.

### Spatial Join:

-   Match sunflower data with the corresponding ecoregion based on geographical coordinates.

### Centroid Calculation:

-   Calculate the centroid of each group of species occurrences within an ecoregion.

### Visualization Preparation:

-   Define custom color and shape mappings for the visualization.

### Plot Assembly:

-   Combine the main plot, legend plots, and title into a final plot layout.

## Output

-   A visualization showing the distribution of selected sunflower species across North American ecoregions.
